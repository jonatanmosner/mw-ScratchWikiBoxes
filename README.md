##Scratch-Wiki Toolboxes

This mediawiki extension adds some useful toolboxes to the Scratch-Wiki.

For now it has still some hardcoded German text passages, but in future versions I will make it multi-language.

The Service-Toolbox contains a code for posting the current page on the Scratch forums, and an optional link reference to the same article in the US-Scratch-Wiki.

It is used from the wiki using ``{{#sk:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|This Page in English}}``
